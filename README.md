# Beyond-AC
Asheron's Call Content

The Goal Here is to promote sharing of both skills and Code for Asheron's Call. This Is a Repository containing all of my Custom content, as well as special Releases that were supported by others who are working towards the goal of sharing and Improving AC.

I will say, this file in it's entirety will load onto a stock AC server clean. However If you have any other content or collisions that is not an Issue that will be tackled by this project. This project will remain dedicated to ensuring no conflicts with the ACE updates but private Servers may have to build thier own landblocks or Reassiagn Landblocks. 

All Weenies for this project will be in the 5,000,000 Range and recording in the spreadsheet on the Wiki Page.
